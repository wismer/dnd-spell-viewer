    When Making an Attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity
    modifier for the Attack and Damage Rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.
  `
};

export const VERSATILE: WeaponProperty = {
  name: 'Versatile',
  description: `
    This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the
    property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee Attack.

export const SILVERED: WeaponProperty = {
  name: 'Silvered',
  description: `
    Some Monsters that have immunity or Resistance to nonmagical Weapons are susceptible to silver Weapons,
    so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their Weapons with silver. You can silver a single
    weapon or ten pieces of Ammunition for 100 gp. This cost represents not only the price of the silver,
    but the time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon without making it less effective.

  description: `
    A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two Weapons.

  name: 'Heavy',
  description: `
    Small creatures have disadvantage on Attack rolls with heavy Weapons. A heavy weapon’s size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.

export const AMMUNITION: WeaponProperty = {
  name: 'Ammunition',
  description: `
    You can use a weapon that has the Ammunition property to make a ranged Attack only if you have Ammunition to fire
    from the weapon. Each time you Attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of Ammunition. Drawing the Ammunition
    from a Quiver, case, or other container is part of the Attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon).
    At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended Ammunition by taking a minute to Search the battlefield.
    If you use a weapon that has the Ammunition property to make a melee Attack, you treat the weapon as an Improvised
    Weapon (see “Improvised Weapons” later in the section). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.
  `
};

export const LOADING: WeaponProperty = {
  name: 'Loading',
  description: `
    Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of Ammunition from it when you use an action,
    Bonus Action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.
  `
};

export const RANGE: WeaponProperty = {
  name: 'Range',
  description: `
    A weapon that can be used to make a ranged Attack has a range in parentheses after the Ammunition or thrown property.
    The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon’s normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon’s long
    range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the Attack roll. You can’t Attack a target
    beyond the weapon’s long range.
  `

export const REACH: WeaponProperty = {

    This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you Attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for Opportunity Attacks with it.

export const THROWN: WeaponProperty = {
  name: 'Thrown',
  description: `
    If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged Attack.
    If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that Attack roll
    and damage roll that you would use for a melee Attack with the weapon. For example, if you
    throw a Handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a Dagger, you can use either your
    Strength or your Dexterity, since the Dagger has the finesse property.
